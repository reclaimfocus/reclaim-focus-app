## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Reclaim Focus! This privacy policy explains how we handle information in relation to our iOS application Reclaim Focus (the "App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our App is designed with privacy at its core. **We do not collect, store, or process any personal data from you.**

This policy is provided in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and relevant German data protection laws (e.g., BDSG).

## 2. Data Controller

The entity responsible for data processing (or lack thereof) in relation to this App is:

Alexander Pavicevic

Scheffelstr 31, 10367 Berlin

## 3. Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be explicitly clear: **Our App does not collect any personal data or usage information.** This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, location, etc.
*   Usage data, analytics, crash reports, or statistics about how you use the App.
*   Device identifiers (like IDFA, device ID, advertising identifiers).
*   Location data.
*   Contacts, photos, or any other content from your device.

The App functions entirely locally on your device without transmitting data to us.

## 4. In-App Purchases

The App offers an optional one-time in-app purchase to unlock the shield customisation. This purchase is processed securely through Apple's App Store using their StoreKit framework.

*   **Apple Handles Payments:** We do **not** collect or have access to your payment information (like credit card details, billing address, or your Apple ID account details). Apple handles the entire transaction process.
*   **Apple's Privacy Policy:** Your purchase is subject to Apple's own Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions. We encourage you to review Apple's policies: [Link to Apple's Privacy Policy - e.g., https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/]
*   **Transaction Confirmation:** We only receive anonymized confirmation from Apple that a purchase has been successfully completed, allowing the App to unlock the purchased content. This confirmation does not contain any personal data identifiable to you by us.

## 5. Use of Information

Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not use any personal data for any purpose.

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not collect personal data, therefore we do not share or disclose any personal data with third parties. The only interaction with a third party is Apple for processing the in-app purchase, as described above.

## 7. Data Retention

We do not collect or store any personal data, so there is no data retention period applicable to us. Any data related to your in-app purchase is managed by Apple according to their policies.

## 8. Your Rights under GDPR

Even though we do not collect personal data through the App, under GDPR, individuals generally have the following rights regarding their personal data:

*   The right to access
*   The right to rectification
*   The right to erasure ('right to be forgotten')
*   The right to restrict processing
*   The right to data portability
*   The right to object
*   Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

Since we do not hold any personal data about you, these rights are generally not applicable in the context of your use of this specific App in relation to us. For any data processed by Apple (e.g., for the purchase), you should exercise your rights directly with Apple.

If you have general questions about our privacy practices, you can contact us using the details in Section 2. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes GDPR.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect any personal data from anyone, including children under the age of 16 (or the relevant minimum age threshold in specific jurisdictions). If you believe we might have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us immediately so we can address the situation.

## 10. International Data Transfers

We do not collect or transfer any personal data. Data processed by Apple for the in-app purchase may be processed internationally according to Apple's privacy policy.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the App Store page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
